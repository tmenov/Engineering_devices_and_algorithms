Ball

It is an explosive device (a finished firecracker) available for repetition with an elementary set of knowledge and basic materials. According to average calculations, a device weighing 6 kg has a blast wave potential at the level of x10 - x15 TNT, that is, 6x10 = 60 - 6x15 = 90 kg TNT.
The device does not have brisant properties since it does not contain brisant components, but due to its power, it can have detonation and properties.
In the basic version, the device has only a blast wave in its potential, but in the case of using certain materials and technologies, a plasma effect can be achieved.
The device is basic for understanding and studying the main properties of devices of this class, namely, Egg devices of all versions and the basic properties of Disk devices of all versions.
The device is easy to manufacture and is available for repetition and mass replication.
