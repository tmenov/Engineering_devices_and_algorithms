Live bullet and launch devices for it.

A live bullet consists of two hemispheres connected inside by a spiral (spring). The spheres are separated by some distance. Inside, the spheres are filled with viscous plastic, similar to the elastic rubber used in rubber bullets. In this case, the spring moves freely in a cylindrical channel inside the plastic filler.
The "cartridge" is a solid piece of phlegmatized nitrocellulose (similar to smokeless powder) with the addition of modified carbon (similar to graphite). The recess for the primer is a hemisphere. The primer is a drop of nitrocellulose. In this case, there are no sleeves or rims on the "cartridge". The bullet is attached to the body of the cartridge at the molding stage.
The metal of the hemispheres and the spring is a bimetallic alloy. The bullet is mounted on automatic machines. First, a spring is mounted in one hemisphere using external contact welding. Then the filler is put on, and the second hemisphere. The spring is stretched and secured outside the second hemisphere using contact welding.
Two weld beads are used to give the bullet a rotational motion in the barrel, which has an internal diameter of about one inch and has two semicircular "riflings". The barrels are made of something like carbon fiber, with a woven structure of carbon fiber with interwoven metal wire.
Similar weapons were used in the war between the Tashigans (constellation Corona Borealis) and the Reptilians (constellation Canes Venatici) about 14,000,000 years ago (according to the solar system time).
