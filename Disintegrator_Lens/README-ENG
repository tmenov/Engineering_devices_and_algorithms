Disintegrator "Lens"

The device is used to split garbage, any waste, including dead bodies. With certain settings, it can split matter into its constituent elements, for example, for dead bodies at the level of amino acids and constituent microelements for further processing at a waste disposal plant.
The device is a lens made of thin silicone film, the lens space is filled with gel, behind the lens there is a radiating surface (similar to LED panels), between the lens and the panel there are two phasing grids.
In the original, the device has the dimensions of a box with two handles on the sides. The box is 30x20x20 cm (approximately). Contains a power supply. There are also modules for robots or production lines.
The range of a manual disintegrator rarely exceeds 2 km, it is usually used at distances of up to 500 meters. For longer distances, other devices are used, such as the Needle or Flower.
The conventional name Lens was given to the device by a group of researchers due to its design. It is worth noting that despite the seemingly primitive simplicity of the design, it has a huge number of complex settings.
Currently (a segment of the time waves of our universe understandable to earthlings), the Lens disintegrator is actively used by many civilizations for waste disposal. This is an active technology.
