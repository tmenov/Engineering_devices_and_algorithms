Disk

A non-nuclear, hydrogen plasma device of explosive type, with electric, magnetic and microgravity pulses.
Available for repetition and mass production with the presence of precise additive printing machines (3D printers), a vacuum foundry and a laboratory for the production of electronic control, launch and navigation systems.
The device is extremely demanding of the highest available production standards.
The device is practically not scalable. In the original it is a disk with a diameter of 33 cm. Described in the literature under the name Sudarshan Chakra.
According to average calculations, with the presence of high-tech automatic launch devices with preliminary trajectory correction, scaling up to 21,978 cm is possible (theoretical data, the presence of a device of this size in our universe could not be detected along the timeline).
According to average calculations, a 6 kg device has a blast wave potential of x1400 - x2800 TNT, i.e. 6x1400=8400 - 6x2800=16,800 kg TNT.
The device has brisant, detonation properties.
According to historical data, about 140 such devices turn blooming planets into cold deserts, this is clearly visible on the example of Mars and has been partially studied by modern science.
The device is technologically advanced, demanding in production standards, and can be repeated.
