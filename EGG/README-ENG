A non-nuclear, hydrogen plasma explosive device.
Available for repetition and mass production, provided that additive printing machines (3D printers), a small foundry at the level of a secondary specialized educational institution workshop and certain skills in handling high explosives are available. When repeating, it is important to maintain proportions. Thus, all versions of the presented devices are available for scaling within any required limits.
According to average calculations, a device weighing 6 kg has a blast wave potential at the level of x40 - x120 TNT, i.e. 6x40 = 240 - 6x120 = 720 kg TNT.
The device has high explosive, detonation properties. The basic version additionally features hydrogen plasma. In the subsequent version, an electric pulse is added. Then a magnetic pulse is added. The potential of this type of device has the properties of a blast wave, hydrogen plasma, electric pulse, magnetic pulse, flash brightness at the level of 10,000 K, and when using certain materials, a microvatational pulse is available (destruction of bonds at the molecular level). However, it is worth noting that the microvatational pulse is not specific to this type of device, while for Disk-type devices it is basic in medium versions of devices. The device is quite technologically advanced and has certain production requirements.
