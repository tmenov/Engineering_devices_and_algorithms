Wave resonant evaporator of matter Flower

Initially, the Flower was planned to be used in combination with a molecular separator of matter and a wave resonant condenser of matter for work on the extraction of minerals from cosmic bodies flying through the solar planetary system. For example, for the abstraction of gold from the asteroid Psyche.
The wave resonant evaporator of matter splits matter into molecules. Outwardly, it looks like when exposed to the Flower, matter passes into a vaporous saturated state, hence the name - evaporator.
The name Flower is conditional. The final stage of the device's emitter looks like a beautiful tropical flower.
Initially, the device was used by scientists from the planet Silbet (the constellation of the Venatic Canes) for work in space. However, earlier the device had a military nature, and due to the anatomical structure of the reptilians, it was used as a hand weapon. Currently, the device is of an archival historical nature and is used to teach students the history of space technology on Silbet and Tashig (the constellation Corona Borealis).
The original latest versions of the device were about 1 m 20 cm long and about 30 cm in diameter.
The device is a set of coils, magnets, and an emitter. In the center of the device is a "pendulum", an incredibly simple device in design, the essence of which our (earthly) scientists have not been able to understand. Together, all these parts work in a single resonance, which is directed in the form of a wave to the desired objects. When exposed to the device, the evaporation of matter occurs instantly.
The range of the device is from 1 meter to 500 km. For longer distances, it is optimal to use the Needle.
